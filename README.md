# javascriptmodal
A project to develop modal windows, using a portfolio website base.

- Used gridbox to create the basic structure of the webpage
- The hidden attribute was used to hide the element from the window
- DOM manipulation was done when a click happens on any of the buttons, leading to modal window appearing
- Keyboard event was also noted, to remove the modal window when any button is pressed.
